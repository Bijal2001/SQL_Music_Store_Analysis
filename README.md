# SQL_Project_Music_Store_Analysis
SQL project to analyze online music store data

This project showcases an end-to-end SQL analysis of a music store's database. The goal is to derive meaningful business insights from customer, invoice, track, and sales data to support decision-making and strategic growth.

# Project Description
Using a structured database of music-related entities (customers, artists, tracks, genres, invoices), I answered a variety of business questions â€” from identifying top customers and best-selling cities to analyzing music genre trends by country. The queries range from beginner to advanced level, incorporating subqueries, joins, CTEs, window functions, and recursive queries.

# Key Objectives
Identify top customers, cities, and high-revenue invoices.

Analyze music preferences across different regions.

Build insights around customer behavior and sales trends.

Practice complex SQL operations like window functions and recursive CTEs.



## Database and Tools
* SQL (PostgreSQL / SQLite / MySQL compatible)
* DB Browser / pgAdmin / SQL Workbench

# Learnings
Writing optimized SQL queries for large datasets.

Working with advanced SQL constructs: window functions, recursive CTEs, subqueries.

Translating business problems into structured query logic.
